# Microbiology Lab Sample Manager

This program is designed to manage samples in a microbiology laboratory.

The program is simple and has very limited functionality, covering only the basics (although based on my experience, it could be functional for a laboratory).

The main goal of the program was to practice using Qt and SQLite for the first time.

Unfortunately, due to the initial project configuration, the program is only available in Spanish. In future projects, I will try to use the Qt translation assistant.

To run the program, simply download the Release folder and execute it.
